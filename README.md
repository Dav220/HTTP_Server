# HTTP_Server
This is an HTTP server written in C. Inspired by BEEJ's Guide to Network Programming. It can currently handle GET requests from clients. It is designed to be able to handle multiple connections at once. It is currently unfinished, and only hosts a minimal HTML webpage at the moment. 

You can type in hhtp://localhost:8080 in a web browser, or type in curl http://localhost:8080 on your terminal to connect to the server that way.
